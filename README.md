### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=iampavangandhi.iampavangandhi&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

I am currently an MSDS (Master of Science in Data Science) at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, United States. I am an aspiring data scientist with an aim to establish myself as a distinguished Data Scientist in the industry. 🚀

I have a passion for problem-solving and pioneering first-principle thinking, driven by purpose and fueled by the challenge of finding solutions, with a strong foundation in Python, Git, Docker, Excel, Postgre SQL, etc. I have been a part of several group projects, many of which I have led and there has been some where I have made crucial contributions.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. When I'm not in code, you'll find me watching tech-related YouTube videos, fueling my curiosity.

Feel free to connect with me @SatvikPraveen or just to say hello! Let's make a mark in data science together. 🌟
